# Text Summarization

<hr>

***Automatic Text Summarization*** is the process of shortening a text document using the deep learning methods. More specifically we will use a seq2seq model for this purpose. This model is widely used in industry today. Search engines are an example. Others include summarization of documents, image collections and videos.
